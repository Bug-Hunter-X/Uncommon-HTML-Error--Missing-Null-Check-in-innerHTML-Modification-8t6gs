This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to modifying innerHTML without proper null checks.  The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code, which might not always produce a visible error in browsers but can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in certain edge cases. The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version with the necessary null check to prevent this.
